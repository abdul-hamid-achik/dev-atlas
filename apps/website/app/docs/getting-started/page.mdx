# Getting Started

Welcome to Dev Atlas! This guide will help you set up and start using the knowledge graph system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **VS Code** or **Cursor** (for the extension)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdul-hamid-achik/dev-atlas.git
cd dev-atlas
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build All Packages

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Install the VS Code Extension

```bash
# Build the extension
