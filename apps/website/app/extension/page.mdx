cd apps/vscode-extension
npm run package
```

## Commands

The extension provides several commands accessible via Ctrl+Shift+P:

- `Dev Atlas: Open Knowledge Graph` - Open the interactive graph visualization
- `Dev Atlas: Create Node` - Create a new knowledge node with guided input
- `Dev Atlas: Create Edge` - Link two nodes together with relationship types

## Views

### Knowledge Graph Explorer
Located in the Explorer panel, this view shows:
- **All Nodes**: Hierarchical list of all knowledge nodes
- **Recent**: Recently accessed nodes
- **Favorites**: Starred nodes for quick access
- **Search**: Live search with results

### Graph Visualizer
The main graph view provides:
- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag and zoom functionality
- **Node Details**: Click nodes to see properties
- **Relationship Lines**: Visual connections between concepts
- **Filtering**: Show/hide different node types

## Configuration

The extension automatically detects and connects to the knowledge graph database in your workspace. The database file (`knowledge-graph.db`) is typically located at the project root.

### Database Location

The extension searches for the database in the following order:
1. Environment variable `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_DIR`
2. Workspace root directory
3. Current working directory

### Customization

While the extension works out-of-the-box, you can customize the experience through VS Code's standard theming and UI settings.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Create Node | Add new knowledge nodes through guided prompts |
| Create Edge | Connect nodes with typed relationships |
| Open Visualizer | Launch interactive graph visualization |

## Development

To contribute to the extension:

```bash
cd apps/vscode-extension

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Package for distribution
npm run package
```

## Extension API

The extension exposes an API for other extensions:

```typescript
import { extensions } from 'vscode';

const devAtlas = extensions.getExtension('dev-atlas.vscode-extension');
if (devAtlas) {
  const api = devAtlas.exports;
  
  // Create a node programmatically
  await api.createNode({
    type: 'concept',
    label: 'New Concept',
    properties: { category: 'architecture' }
  });
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
