# Getting Started

Welcome to Dev Atlas! This guide will help you set up and start using the knowledge graph system for developers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **npm** >= 10.0.0  
- **VS Code** or **Cursor** (for the extension)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/dev-atlas.git
cd dev-atlas
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the MCP Server

```bash
# Start the MCP Knowledge Graph server
npm run dev --workspace=@dev-atlas/mcp-knowledge-graph
```

The server will start on the default port and create a SQLite database for storing your knowledge graph.

### 4. Install the VS Code Extension

```bash
# Build the extension
npm run build --workspace=@dev-atlas/vscode-extension

# Package the extension
cd apps/vscode-extension
npm run package
```

Then install the generated `.vsix` file in VS Code/Cursor:
1. Open VS Code/Cursor
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Click the "..." menu and select "Install from VSIX..."
4. Select the generated `.vsix` file

4. Select a type (e.g., "Component", "Concept", "Feature")

### Creating Relationships

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)  
2. Type "Dev Atlas: Create Edge"
3. Select the source node
4. Select the target node
5. Define the relationship type (e.g., "depends_on", "implements", "uses")
