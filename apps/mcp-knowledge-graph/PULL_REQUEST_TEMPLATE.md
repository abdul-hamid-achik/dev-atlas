## Add Dev Atlas Knowledge Graph MCP Server

### Summary
This PR adds the **Dev Atlas Knowledge Graph** MCP server to the Docker registry. This server enables AI assistants to create, manage, and traverse knowledge graphs stored in SQLite, providing persistent memory and relationship mapping capabilities.

### Server Information
- **Name**: dev-atlas-knowledge-graph
- **Repository**: https://github.com/abdul-hamid-achik/dev-atlas
- **Version**: 2.0.1
- **License**: MIT

### Features
- üîó **Graph Operations**: Full CRUD operations for nodes and edges
- üîç **Advanced Search**: Query and traverse complex relationships
- üíæ **Persistent Storage**: SQLite-based storage with Drizzle ORM
- üéØ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript implementation with Zod validation
- ü§ñ **AI-Optimized**: Designed specifically for AI assistant workflows
- üìä **Knowledge Management**: Map and connect concepts, entities, and data points

### Use Cases
- Building persistent memory for AI assistants
- Creating semantic knowledge networks
- Mapping relationships between concepts and entities
- Storing and retrieving contextual information
- Building domain-specific knowledge bases

### Technical Details
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 Alpine
- **Database**: SQLite with Better-SQLite3
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK

### Docker Image
